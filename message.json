    "Dear Elizabeth,\n\nI hope you're doing well and feeling the same warmth and joy that has filled my heart since last night. I just wanted to let you know how proud and amazed I am of you.\n\nLast night was a big moment. Watching you face that crossroads and choose a new path was incredible. It showed me so much about your strength and how much you care. That one gesture spoke volumes.\n\nIn that moment, I felt more connected to you than ever. Your decision to change course wasn't just a choice; it was a testament to your commitment to us. It brought a warmth I haven't felt in a long time and rekindled the hope and love inside me.\n\nYour actions last night were like a guiding light, helping me through any doubts I had. They reminded me of the amazing person you are!\n\nI want you to know that I'm here for you, now and always. I'm committed to supporting you and walking this path with you, no matter where it leads. Together, we're stronger, and we can overcome anything.\n\nLast night was a reminder that love is a choice to be kind, patient, and believe in each other, even when the road ahead is uncertain. Your choice to take a new path filled me with hope and reinforced my belief in our bond.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of you, Elizabeth. I'm proud of you and who you're becoming. Your inner light shines brightly. Even managing to light up someone like me, someone that was willing to let the dark take them.\n\nAs we move forward together, always remember no matter what happens, I will stand beside you and will always pick you up if you stumble. If you fall, I will catch you. If you are scared to walk forward, I will go first, and if you canâ€™t look on the bright side, then I will sit with you in the dark.\n\nThank you, Elizabeth, for being the incredible person you are. Thank you for your courage, kindness, and support. Thank you for choosing a new path and showing me the depth of your love and commitment.\n\nWith all my love,\nNicholas"
